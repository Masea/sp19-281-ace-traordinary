https://www.linux.com/news/7-essential-open-source-devops-projects  -- Something to explore and adapt ideas from.

Project Idea:

Find Partner / Team Social Network for campus:

There will be multiple events / activities like -

- academic -> combined study ->  subject
- academic -> campus events
- professional -> out of campus events
- casual

A basic networking website for teaming up for different activities.
Can be scaled outside campus by adding more activities
